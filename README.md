# IEEE-IAS-A-VOW
This project basically is about living a gender unbaised life. I made this project during PRIDE month for the LGBTq community to get empowered and inspiring the society to consider them as equal citizens

# INSPIRATION 
I have seen lot many times that the community is getting gender biased. Hence, built this project to make people aware about this thing. 
# Challenges we ran into
There were not really big challenges. Many times , i used to get struck, referred google, asked seniors to help.

# What we learned
Indeed the learning outcome of this project cannot be ignored. I basically brushed all my frontend skills and also learnt how to cross challeges if encountered

# TECH USED
HTML  CSS  JAVASCRIPT
